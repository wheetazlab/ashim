# Contributing to Stirling Image

Thanks for your interest in contributing. There are many ways to help beyond writing code: reporting bugs, suggesting features, improving docs, and adding translations.

## Issues

Before opening an issue, search existing ones to avoid duplicates.

- **Bug reports**: Include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and your environment (OS, Docker version, browser).
- **Feature requests**: Describe the problem you want solved, not just the solution. Context helps.
- **Questions**: Open an issue. We will do our best to respond quickly.

## Pull requests

1. **Open an issue first.** Describe what you want to change and why. Wait for a maintainer to confirm the direction before writing code.
2. **Fork the repo** and create a branch from `main`.
3. **Make your changes.** Follow the conventions in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) (formatting, file structure, commit style).
4. **Test your changes.** Run `pnpm test` and `pnpm lint` before pushing. If you changed UI, run `pnpm test:e2e` too.
5. **Submit a PR.** Reference the issue number. Keep the title short and descriptive.

### Commit messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated releases:

- `feat:` new feature (triggers a minor version bump)
- `fix:` bug fix (triggers a patch version bump)
- `docs:` documentation only
- `test:` adding or fixing tests
- `refactor:` code change that doesn't fix a bug or add a feature
- `chore:` maintenance (CI, deps, config)

Example: `feat: add HEIC to PNG conversion support`

### What makes a good PR

- One logical change per PR. If you need to refactor something to add a feature, that can be one PR, but don't mix unrelated changes.
- Clear commit messages that explain why, not just what.
- Tests for new behavior when possible.
- No unrelated formatting changes (Biome handles formatting).

## Development setup

Full instructions are in the [Developer Guide](https://stirling-image.github.io/stirling-image/guide/developer). The short version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stirling-image/stirling-image.git
cd stirling-image
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # starts both frontend and backend
```

The frontend runs at http://localhost:1349 and proxies API calls to the backend on port 13490.

### Running tests

```bash
pnpm lint           # Biome lint + format check
pnpm typecheck      # TypeScript across all workspaces
pnpm test           # unit + integration tests
pnpm test:e2e       # Playwright end-to-end tests
```

All of these run in CI on every PR. Make sure they pass locally first.

## Adding a new tool

Tools follow a consistent pattern. You will need to touch three places:

1. **Backend route** in `apps/api/src/routes/tools/` using `createToolRoute()` from the tool factory.
2. **Frontend settings component** in `apps/web/src/components/tools/` with the tool's UI controls.
3. **i18n entry** in `packages/shared/src/i18n/en.ts` with the tool's name and description.

See the [Developer Guide](https://stirling-image.github.io/stirling-image/guide/developer) for a walkthrough.

## Translations

We currently ship English only, but the i18n system is designed for easy extension. If you want to add a language, see the [Translation Guide](https://stirling-image.github.io/stirling-image/guide/translations).

## Code style

Biome handles formatting and linting. The rules are in `biome.json` and enforced by a pre-commit hook. Don't modify the Biome or TypeScript config files to silence warnings. Fix the code instead.

Quick summary:

- Double quotes, semicolons, 2-space indentation
- ES modules everywhere
- Zod for API input validation
- No `any` types without justification

## License and Contributor License Agreement

Stirling Image is dual-licensed under the [AGPLv3](LICENSE) and a commercial license. To keep this dual-licensing possible, all contributions must be submitted under the following terms:

By submitting a pull request or otherwise contributing code to this project, you agree that:

1. Your contributions are your original work (or you have the right to submit them).
2. You grant the project maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, sublicense, and relicense your contributions under any license, including the AGPLv3 and any commercial license offered for this project.
3. You understand that your contributions will be publicly available under the AGPLv3 and may also be included in commercially licensed versions of the software.

This is necessary because the project offers a commercial license alongside the open-source AGPLv3. Without this agreement, contributed code could only be distributed under the AGPLv3, which would prevent offering a commercial option.

If you have questions about this, open an issue before contributing.
