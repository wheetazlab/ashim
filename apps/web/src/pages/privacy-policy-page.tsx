            <p>
              Stirling Image is a self-hosted, open-source image processing application. Your
              instance is operated and controlled entirely by whoever deployed it. This policy
              describes how the software itself handles your data.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Local Processing</h2>
            <p>
              All image processing happens entirely on the server where Stirling Image is deployed.
              Your images are never sent to external services or third-party APIs. When you upload
              an image for processing, it is handled in memory or in temporary storage on the host
              machine and is not retained after the operation completes.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">No Tracking or Analytics</h2>
            <p>
              Stirling Image does not include any telemetry, analytics, or tracking. No data is
              collected about your usage patterns, and no information is sent to Stirling Image
              developers or any third party. There are no cookies used for tracking purposes.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Data Storage</h2>
            <p>
              If authentication is enabled, the application stores user accounts (usernames and
              hashed passwords) in a local SQLite database on the host machine. If you use the Files
              feature, uploaded files are stored on the server's filesystem. All stored data remains
              entirely under the control of the instance operator.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">No Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
              Stirling Image does not integrate with or send data to any external services.
              AI-powered features (background removal, upscaling, OCR) run locally using bundled
              models. No cloud APIs are involved.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Open Source</h2>
            <p>
              Stirling Image is fully open source. You can audit the source code to verify these
              claims at any time. Transparency is a core principle of this project.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Your Control</h2>
            <p>
              Because Stirling Image is self-hosted, the instance operator has full control over all
              data. You can delete your data at any time by removing files from the server or
              deleting the database. No data exists outside of your infrastructure.
