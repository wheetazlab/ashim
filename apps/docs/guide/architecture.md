# Architecture

Stirling Image is a monorepo managed with pnpm workspaces and Turborepo. Everything ships as a single Docker container.

## Packages

### `@stirling-image/image-engine`

The core image processing library built on [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/). It handles all non-AI operations: resize, crop, rotate, flip, convert, compress, strip metadata, and color adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation, grayscale, sepia, invert, color channels).

This package has no network dependencies and runs entirely in-process.

### `@stirling-image/ai`

A bridge layer that calls Python scripts for ML operations. On first use, the bridge starts a persistent Python dispatcher process that pre-imports heavy libraries (rembg, OpenCV, NumPy) and keeps them warm in memory. Subsequent AI calls skip the import overhead entirely. If the dispatcher is unavailable, the bridge falls back to spawning a fresh Python subprocess per request.

Supported operations:
- **Background removal** -- BiRefNet-Lite model via rembg
- **Upscaling** -- RealESRGAN
- **OCR** -- PaddleOCR
- **Face detection/blurring** -- MediaPipe
- **Object erasing (inpainting)** -- LaMa Cleaner

Python scripts live in `packages/ai/python/`. The Docker image pre-downloads all model weights during the build so the container works offline.

### `@stirling-image/shared`

Shared TypeScript types, constants (like `APP_VERSION` and tool definitions), and i18n translation strings used by both the frontend and backend.

## Applications

### API (`apps/api`)

A Fastify v5 server that handles:
- File uploads, temporary workspace management, and persistent file storage
- Tool execution (routes each tool request to the image engine or AI bridge)
- Pipeline orchestration (chaining multiple tools sequentially)
- Batch processing with concurrency control via p-queue
- User authentication, teams, API key management, and rate limiting
- Admin settings (tool visibility, feature flags, cleanup config, branding)
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation at `/api/docs`
- Serving the built frontend as a SPA in production

Key dependencies: Fastify, Drizzle ORM, better-sqlite3, Sharp, Piscina (worker thread pool), Zod for validation.

The server handles graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT: it drains HTTP connections, stops the worker pool, shuts down the Python dispatcher, and closes the database.

### Web (`apps/web`)

A React 19 single-page app built with Vite. Uses Zustand for state management, Tailwind CSS v4 for styling, and Lucide for icons. Communicates with the API over REST and SSE (for progress tracking).

Pages include a tool workspace, a Files page for managing persistent uploads and results, an automation/pipeline builder, and an admin settings panel.

The built frontend gets served by the Fastify backend in production, so there is no separate web server in the Docker container.

### Docs (`apps/docs`)

This VitePress site. Deployed to GitHub Pages automatically on push to `main`.

## How a request flows

1. The user picks a tool in the web UI and uploads an image.
2. The frontend sends a multipart POST to `/api/v1/tools/:toolId` with the file and settings.
3. The API route validates the input with Zod, then dispatches processing.
4. For standard tools, the request is offloaded to a Piscina worker thread pool so Sharp operations don't block the main event loop. The worker auto-orients the image based on EXIF metadata, runs the tool's process function, and returns the result. If the worker pool is unavailable, processing falls back to the main thread.
5. For AI tools, the TypeScript bridge sends a request to the persistent Python dispatcher (or spawns a fresh subprocess as fallback), waits for it to finish, and reads the output file.
6. Job progress is persisted to the `jobs` SQLite table so state survives container restarts. Real-time updates are delivered via SSE at `/api/v1/jobs/:jobId/progress`.
7. The API returns a `jobId` and `downloadUrl`. The user downloads the processed image from `/api/v1/download/:jobId/:filename`.

For pipelines, the API feeds the output of each step as input to the next, running them sequentially.

For batch processing, the API uses p-queue with a configurable concurrency limit (`CONCURRENT_JOBS`) and returns a ZIP file with all processed images.
