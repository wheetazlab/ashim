## Key Features

- **30+ image tools** - Resize, crop, compress, convert, watermark, color adjust, and more
- **Local AI** - Remove backgrounds, upscale images, erase objects, blur faces, extract text (OCR). All running on your hardware with pre-downloaded models, no internet required
- **Pipelines** - Chain tools into reusable workflows. Batch process up to 200 images at once
- **REST API** - Every tool available via API. Interactive docs included at `/api/docs`
- **Single container** - One `docker run`, no Redis, no Postgres, no external services
- **Multi-arch** - Runs on AMD64 and ARM64 (Intel, Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi)
- **Your data stays yours** - No telemetry, no tracking, no external calls. Images never leave your machine

## Quick Start

```bash
docker run -d -p 1349:1349 -v ashim-data:/data ashimhq/ashim:latest
```

Open http://localhost:1349 in your browser.

<details>
<summary><sub>Have an NVIDIA GPU? Click here for GPU acceleration.</sub></summary>
<br>

Add `--gpus all` for GPU-accelerated background removal, upscaling, and OCR:

```bash
docker run -d -p 1349:1349 --gpus all -v ashim-data:/data ashimhq/ashim:latest
```

> Requires an NVIDIA GPU and [Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html). Falls back to CPU if no GPU is found. See [Docker Tags](https://ashim-hq.github.io/ashim/guide/docker-tags) for benchmarks and Docker Compose examples.
